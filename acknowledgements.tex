I would like to express my deep appreciation to my current advisor Dr. Michael A. Scott and former advisor Dr. Michael J. Borden for leading me to computational science and their support and guidance during my study. This dissertation would not have been finished without their untiring help and capable support. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Derek C. Thomas, Dr. Emily Evans and Dr. David W. Jensen for their time and service as my committee members. I am particularly indebted to Dr. Mohammed A. Zikry, Dr. Paul I. Ro and Dr. Murthy Guddati at the North Carolina State University who encouraged me to never give up at the darkest moment of my PhD career. I am equally grateful to all members of staff at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering here for their assistance these years. \par

Finally, for my family, no word can express my thanks owed to them. My father, Jianzhong Miao and my mother, Yufen Zhang have supported me both spiritally and physically. Thanks for their understanding, patience and sacrifices during these years. The deepest gratitude goes to my wife, Shujing Duan for her endless support and priceless trust to me.
