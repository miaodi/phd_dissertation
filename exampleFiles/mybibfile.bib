	abstract = {This paper provides a detailed elaboration and assessment of the most common domain decomposition methods for their application in isogeometric analysis. The methods comprise a penalty approach, Lagrange multiplier methods, and a Nitsche-type method. For the Nitsche method, a new stabilized formulation is developed in the context of isogeometric analysis to guarantee coercivity. All these methods are investigated on problems of linear elasticity and eigenfrequency analysis in 2D. In particular, focus is put on non-uniform rational B-spline patches which join nonconformingly along their common interface. Thus, the application of isogeometric analysis is extended to multi-patches, which can have an arbitrary parametrization on the adjacent edges. Moreover, it has been shown that the unique properties provided by isogeometric analysis, that is, high-order functions and smoothness across the element boundaries, carry over for the analysis of multiple domains.

The current work studies the weak enforcement of such conditions for B-spline basis functions, with application to both second- and fourth-order problems. This is achieved using concepts borrowed from Nitsche's method, which is a stabilized method for imposing constraints on surfaces. Conditions for the stability of the system of equations are derived for each class of problem. Stability parameters in the Nitsche weak form are then evaluated by solving a local generalized eigenvalue problem at the Dirichlet boundary. The approach is designed to work equally well when the grid used to build the splines conforms to the physical boundary of interest as well as to the more general case when it does not. Through several numerical examples, the approach is shown to yield optimal rates of convergence. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Thin shell structures are widely used in the aerospace, automotive and mechanical engineering industries. They are ideal candidates for the isogeometric analysis paradigm profiting from the smoothness of the geometry model, and the higher order approximation and higher continuity properties of NURBS. To model complex shell structures which need to be assembled from multiple patches, the bending stiffness should be maintained across the patch interfaces. We propose a variationally consistent weak coupling method for thin-walled shell patches. The method overcomes the need for C 1 -continuity along the patch interface to ensure a corresponding geometric continuity in the deformed configuration and a correct transfer of bending moments across the interface. Importantly, it allows a blended coupling of shells based on different mathematical models, e.g. Kirchhoff–Love and solid-like shell models. The proposed approach retains the high level of accuracy of single patch solutions and reveals its potential for authentic multi-patch NURBS modeling. We illustrate the good performance of the method for pure Kirchhoff–Love shell models and blended shell models with various examples. The presented approach supports local model refinements where e.g. full 3D stress states are of interest, and further opens the door for the coupling of laminated composites belonging to different lamina theories.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple yet flexible method for coupling non-conforming NURBS patches in isogeometric frameworks. It consists of virtually refining bordering patches to derive coupling constraints in a master–slave formulation. These constraints are then enforced via a substitution method for condensation of the slave variables, thereby reducing the model size. In the special case of hierarchical meshes, the method results in an exact connection. For an arbitrary non-conforming configuration, the master–slave formulation takes the interface constraints into account in a least-squares sense. This yields an accurate weak coupling without overconstraining the interface. The coupling relationships only depend on the mesh itself and not on any problem-dependent parameters, allowing them to be generated in a pre-processing step with very limited numerical efforts. Besides this low computational cost, the main merit of the proposed method lies in its simplicity and robustness, yielding good results for arbitrarily strongly non-conforming patch configurations. Several numerical examples are studied for different problem types requiring C 0 - or C 1 -continuity, in particular time-harmonic acoustics and (dynamic) thin plate bending. Benchmarking of the proposed approach against existing similar techniques illustrates its superior accuracy and robustness.},

The current work presents an indirect variational BEM which makes use of NURBS shape functions. Additionally, a novel technique for coupling (strongly) non-conforming patches is introduced to allow the analysis of more complex geometries. The proposed isogeometric indirect boundary element method is verified against analytical solutions and benchmarked against the conventional polynomial-based indirect BEM. Also two open-boundary problems are studied, including analyses over wider frequency ranges, and one industrial-type, complex geometry containing multiple non-conforming patches. The proposed method is found to be not only significantly more efficient than its polynomial-based counterpart, but also very robust against strong non-conformities in the NURBS descriptions.},

The method is derived by adding a coarse problem to the recently proposed transient FETI substructuring algorithm in order to propagate the error globally and accelerate convergence. It is proved that in the limit for large time steps, the new method converges toward the FETI algorithm for time-independent problems. Computational results confirm that the optimal convergence properties of the time-independent FETI method are preserved in the time-dependent case. We employ an iterative scheme for solving efficiently the coarse problem on massively parallel processors, and demonstrate the effective scalability of the new transient FETI method with the large-scale finite element dynamic analysis on the Paragon XP/S and IBM SP2 systems of several diffraction grating finite element structural models. We also show that this new domain decomposition method outperforms the popular direct skyline solver. The coarse problem presented herein is applicable and beneficial to a large class of Lagrange multiplier based substructuring algorithms for time-dependent problems, including the fictitious domain decomposition method.},

	abstract = {In this contribution, a mortar-type method for the coupling of non-conforming NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-spline) surface patches is proposed. The connection of non-conforming patches with shared degrees of freedom requires mutual refinement, which propagates throughout the whole patch due to the tensor-product structure of NURBS surfaces. Thus, methods to handle non-conforming meshes are essential in NURBS-based isogeometric analysis. The main objective of this work is to provide a simple and efficient way to couple the individual patches of complex geometrical models without altering the variational formulation. The deformations of the interface control points of adjacent patches are interrelated with a master-slave relation. This relation is established numerically using the weak form of the equality of mutual deformations along the interface. With the help of this relation, the interface degrees of freedom of the slave patch can be condensated out of the system. A natural connection of the patches is attained without additional terms in the weak form. The proposed method is also applicable for nonlinear computations without further measures. Linear and geometrical nonlinear examples show the high accuracy and robustness of the new method. A comparison to reference results and to computations with the Lagrange multiplier method is given.

	abstract = {In recent years, isogeometric analysis (IGA) has received great attention in many fields of computational mechanics research. Especially for computational contact mechanics, an exact and smooth surface representation is highly desirable. As a consequence, many well-known finite element methods and algorithms for contact mechanics have been transferred to IGA. In the present contribution, the so-called dual mortar method is investigated for both contact mechanics and classical domain decomposition using NURBS basis functions. In contrast to standard mortar methods, the use of dual basis functions for the Lagrange multiplier based on the mathematical concept of biorthogonality enables an easy elimination of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom from the global system. This condensed system is smaller in size, and no longer of saddle point type but positive definite. A very simple and commonly used element-wise construction of the dual basis functions is directly transferred to the IGA case. The resulting Lagrange multiplier interpolation satisfies discrete inf–sup stability and biorthogonality, however, the reproduction order is limited to one. In the domain decomposition case, this results in a limitation of the spatial convergence order to O ( h 3 2 ) in the energy norm, whereas for unilateral contact, due to the lower regularity of the solution, optimal convergence rates are still met. Numerical examples are presented that illustrate these theoretical considerations on convergence rates and compare the newly developed isogeometric dual mortar contact formulation with its standard mortar counterpart as well as classical finite elements based on first and second order Lagrange polynomials.},

The advantage of this new approach is that the matching condition is much easier to realize. In particular, all the basis functions of the new method are supported in a few elements.

abstract = {In this work, we develop a mortar method for the coupling of non-conforming NURBS subdomains within a NURBS patch that keeps the benefit of using more regular functions. The idea is to use two Lagrange multipliers to match, across the coupling interface, the tractions coming from the discrete displacements in addition to the discrete displacements. It results in a strategy that is suitable with the continuity of the physical solution: when the physical solution is sufficiently smooth, the strategy enables to represent a C 1 behavior; but, when only a C 0 displacement is expected, no additional errors are introduced since only the traction force is continuous and not the whole derivative fields. Lower stress jumps at the coupling interface can then be observed which allows for a better transition of the information. As an application, a non-intrusive algorithm is also built to solve the proposed coupling method, which enables simple and flexible local enrichments of NURBS patches without losing the interest of using more regular functions. A range of numerical examples in two-dimensional linear elasticity are carried out along with comparisons with other published NURBS coupling techniques to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coupling and its interest when combined to a non-intrusive strategy.},

	abstract = {The use of a common set of basis functions for design and analysis is the main paradigm of isogeometric analysis. The characteristics of the commonly used non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) surfaces require methods to handle non-conforming meshes to attain an efficient computational framework. The isogeometric mortar method uses constrained approximation spaces to enforce a coupling of deformations at the interface between patches in a weak manner. This method neither requires additional degrees of freedom nor the choice of empirical parameters. The main drawback of the standard isogeometric mortar approach is the non-local support of the mortar basis functions along the interface. This yields a large number of nodes per element for elements adjacent to the interface. Thus, the computational costs increase significantly for mesh refinement. This issue is remedied by the use of dual basis functions for the mortar method, which is referred to as dual mortar method. In this contribution several choices for the dual basis functions for B-splines are proposed and compared. A special focus is set on the support of the dual basis functions and on the support of the resulting mortar basis functions. Numerical examples show the influence of the choice for the dual basis functions on the accuracy of the global stress distribution, on the fulfillment of the interface conditions and on numerical efficiency. The use of approximate dual basis functions is shown to be competitive to computations of conforming meshes in terms of accuracy and efficiency. (© 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

abstract = {This contribution defines and compares different methods for the computation of dual basis functions for B-splines and Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS). They are intended to be used as test functions for the isogeometric mortar method, but other fields of application are possible, too. Three different concepts are presented and compared. The first concept is the explicit formula for the computation of dual basis functions for NURBS proposed in the work of Carl de Boor. These dual basis functions entail minimal support, i.e., the support of the dual basis functions is equal to the support of the corresponding B-spline basis functions. In the second concept dual basis functions are derived from the inversion of the Gram matrix. These dual basis functions have global support along the interface. The third concept is the use of approximate dual basis functions, which were initially proposed for the use in harmonic analysis. The support of these functions is local but larger than the support of the associated B-spline basis functions. We propose an extension of the approximate dual basis functions for NURBS basis functions. After providing the general formulas, we elaborate explicit expressions for several degrees of spline basis functions. All three approaches are applied in the frame of the mortar method for the coupling of non-conforming NURBS patches. A method which allows complex discretizations with multiple intersecting interfaces is presented. Numerical examples show that the explicitly defined dual basis functions with minimal support severely deteriorate the global stress convergence behavior of the mechanical analysis. This fact is in accordance with mathematical findings in literature, which state that the optimal reproduction degree of arbitrary functions is not possible without extending the support of the dual basis functions. The dual basis functions computed from the inverse of the Gram matrix yield accurate numerical results but the global support yields significantly higher computational costs in comparison to computations of conforming meshes. Only the approximate dual basis functions yield accurate and efficient computations, where neither accuracy nor efficiency is significantly deteriorated in comparison to computations of conforming meshes. All basic cases of T-intersections and star-intersections are studied. Furthermore, an example which combines all basic cases in a complex discretization is given. The applicability of the presented method for the nonlinear case and for shell formulations is shown with the help of one numerical example.},

abstract = {One key feature of isogeometric analysis is that it allows smooth shape functions. Indeed, when isogeometric spaces are constructed from p-degree splines (and extensions, such as NURBS), they enjoy up to C p − 1 continuity within each patch. However, global continuity beyond C 0 on so-called multi-patch geometries poses some significant difficulties. In this work, we consider planar multi-patch domains that have a parametrization which is only C 0 at the patch interface. On such domains we study the h-refinement of C 1 -continuous isogeometric spaces. These spaces in general do not have optimal approximation properties. The reason is that the C 1 -continuity condition easily over-constrains the solution which is, in the worst cases, fully locked to linears at the patch interface. However, recently (Kapl et al., 2015b) has given numerical evidence that optimal convergence occurs for bilinear two-patch geometries and cubic (or higher degree) C 1 splines. This is the starting point of our study. We introduce the class of analysis-suitable G 1 geometry parametrizations, which includes piecewise bilinear parametrizations. We then analyze the structure of C 1 isogeometric spaces over analysis-suitable G 1 parametrizations and, by theoretical results and numerical testing, discuss their approximation properties. We also consider examples of geometry parametrizations that are not analysis-suitable, showing that in this case optimal convergence of C 1 isogeometric spaces is prevented.},

It is shown that, written under primal hybrid formulation, the approximation problem, issued from a discretization of a second order elliptic equation in 2D, is nonetheless well posed and provides a discrete solution that satisfies optimal error estimates with respect to natural norms. Finally the parallelization advantages consequence of this variant are also addressed.},

In fact, only the shape function subroutine needs to be modified while all other aspects of a finite element program remain the same. A byproduct of the extraction process is the element extraction operator. This operator localizes the topological and global smoothness information to the element level, and represents a canonical treatment of T-junctions, referred to as ‘hanging nodes’ in finite element analysis and a fundamental feature of T-splines.

T-splines allow the introduction of so-called T-junctions, which are related to hanging nodes in the standard FEM. Obeying a few straightforward rules, rectangular patches in the parameter space of the T-splines can be subdivided and thus a local refinement becomes feasible while still preserving the exact geometry. Furthermore, it is shown how state-of-the-art a posteriori error estimation techniques can be combined with refinement by T-splines.

For non-rectangular meshes, it generates surfaces that are shown to reduce to a standard B-spline surface except at a small number of points, called extraordinary points. Therefore, everywhere except at these points the surface is continuous in tangent and curvature. At the extraordinary points, the pictures of the surface indicate that the surface is at least continuous in tangent, but no proof of continuity is given. A similar algorithm for biquadratic B-splines is also presented.},

The seven methods include two that are new to isogeometric analysis. Both new methods yield O(h3) convergence in the L2 norm, also when points are included where n 6≠ 4 pieces meet.

This strategy allows us to integrate geometric modeling and physical simulation. The geometries can be open and with holes. Our proposed method performs geometric modeling via the extended Loop's subdivision which allows arbitrary topological structure, treats concave/convex vertices, and has at least C 1 -continuity everywhere. It is capable of handling domains with arbitrary shaped boundary represented by piecewise cubic B-spline curves. We apply an efficient integration technique to the domain elements with a fast evaluation technique for closed Loop's subdivision surfaces. As an example, the Poisson equation is solved on three planar domains. We develop the approximate estimation of finite element in the limit function space of the extended Loop's subdivision. A detailed study on the convergence character is given with the comparison to the classical finite element analysis (FEA) with linear elements. Numerical experiments are consistent with our theoretical results. It shows that compared with the FEA with linear elements, the IGA scheme based on extended Loop's subdivision converges faster and behaves more robustly with respect to the mesh quality.},

	abstract = {Subdivision surfaces offer great flexibility in capturing irregular topologies combined with higher order smoothness. For instance, Loop and Catmull–Clark subdivision schemes provide C 2 smoothness everywhere except at extraordinary vertices, where the generated surfaces are C 1 smooth. The combination of flexibility and smoothness leads to their frequent use in geometric modeling and makes them an ideal candidate for performing isogeometric analysis of higher order problems with irregular topologies, e.g. thin shell problems. In the neighborhood of extraordinary vertices, however, the resulting surfaces (and the functions defined on them) are non-polynomial. Thus numerical integration based on quadrature has to be performed carefully to preserve the expected higher order consistency.
			This paper presents a detailed case study of different quadrature schemes for isogeometric discretizations of partial differential equations on closed surfaces with Loop’s subdivision scheme. As model problems we consider elliptic equations with the Laplace–Beltrami and the surface bi-Laplacian operator as well as the associated eigenvalue problem for the Laplace–Beltrami operator. A particular emphasis is on the robustness of the approach in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices. Based on a series of numerical experiments, different quadrature schemes are compared. Mid-edge quadrature, which can easily be implemented via a lookup table, turns out to be a preferable choice due to its robustness and efficiency.},

abstract = {Refinement is usually advocated as a means of gaining finer control over a spline curve or surface during editing. For curves, refinement is a local process. It permits the change of control vertices and subsequent editing of the detail in one region of the curve while leaving control vertices in other regions unaffected. For tensor-product surfaces, however, refinement is not local in the sense that it causes control vertices far from a region of interest to change as well as changing the control vertices that influence the region. However, with some care and understanding it is possible to restrict the influence of refinement to the locality at which an editing effect is desired. We present a method of localizing the effect of refinement through the use of overlays, which are hierarchically controlled subdivisions. We also introduce two editing techniques that are effective when using overlays: one is direct surface manipulation through the use of edit points and the other is offset referencing of control vertices.},
